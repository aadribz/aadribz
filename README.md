- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aadribz
- I'm a student of biotechnology, currently in my last year of master's degree
- In recent past, I've decided to explore the field of IT, and who knows, maybe I'll somehow connect it with my major in the future :)
- If you somehow stumble upon my profile, please take note that programming is not my homeland, I'm justi na process of learning and my projects serve similar purpose like a photo album for example
